# Museum54
- Client: https://github.com/jmehart/Museum54-Client

## PROBLEM SOLVED
- This application helps museum curators keep track of the data that follows museum art and artifacts. With extensive sensitive data to keep track of, it’s crucial that museums have the ability to enter correct information into a database and also access that information when handling art. This app also offers a visually appealing front-end display to enter forms and view art in the collection, because even a museum’s database should look pretty.

## OVERVIEW 
- The main purpose of the Museum54 app is to offer data solutions to museum curators by supplying a database that tracks art, artists, and collections. With this data, the app also stores users (museum curators and employees) and when they add data to the database. Classifications, styles, and genres that are attributed with the art piece are also tracked in their own data tables for a user to quickly choose from a dropdown when filling out a form to donate art to a collection. 
- A user can fill out two separate forms, one for an artist and one for art. An artist is submitted first and then the user can select an artist from the dropdown on the art form. On the Collection page a user can view all of the art in the collection in a grid format and there are also separate pages for an individual work of art, list of artists, and also an individual artist page.
